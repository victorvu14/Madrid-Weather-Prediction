# Madrid-Weather-Prediction

The work consists in analyzing a big dataset with hourly pollution data from Madrid, in the period 2011 to 2016.

There are 4 major parts of the project. 

1. Reading every piece of raw data and creating the whole initial raw_data set.
2. Processing raw_data to create a daily dataset, by averaging each hourly measure, and containing also the weather variables and the
names for each pollutant parameter.
3. Generating a descriptive analysis with correlation matrices, scatterplots, time series charts â€¦
4. Creating a linear regression model that explains NO2
